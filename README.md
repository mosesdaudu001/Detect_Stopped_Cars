Hi my name is `Moses Daudu`

In this repo, You will see how to detect vehicles that stopped in a given video.

## Step 1:
Install all requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2: Run the `python` file
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Contact Moses at `mosesdaudu001@gmail.com` for adjustments to suit your needs.

### Side Notes:
1. I used masks to improvve the efficiency of the detector. But as I'm sure that you are already aware that masks are specific to the video and so you would need your own customly made masks.
